# Interactive - 03 - Select data back from the table

Data is more fun when you can put some in and get it 
back later.  Enter "select".

```
SELECT * from name_list;

```

gives you get back all the data.  The `*` is the list
of columns you get back.  `*` is for all the columns.

```
SELECT real_name, state from name_list;

```

Gives you back just the name and state.

```

SELECT lower(real_name) as "real_name_lower", real_name
from name_list;

```

gives you back a lower case version of the name.

Or make it in order from z to a.

```

SELECT lower(real_name) as "real_name_lower", real_name
	from name_list
	order by 1 desc
;

```

Maybe we just want the names in Wyoming.  This is the
where clause.

```

SELECT real_name
	FROM name_list
	WHERE state = 'WY'
;

```

Remember that if you want to match a text field you
have to use quotes.  Also it is case sensitive.

```
select real_name
from name_list
where state = 'wy'
;
```

will not give you any rows.  Try it.
