# Interactive - 13 - drop both tables

Let's try getting rid of our 2 tables.   Our first attempt to do this will fail.

```
drop table us_state;
```

We have a dependency via foreign constraint on us_state.  That is name_list.

We can do this in order - or we can use an option to "cascade" the drops.
"cascade" is powerful but dangerous.  In PosgreSQL it will drop the table
and associated constraints.  In Oracle it cascades to the tables referenced!


```
m4_include(hw13_2.sql)
```



Now use the supplied script to re-create the tables.  There will be some additional
columns when you do this that we will use in future homework exercises.

The file is hw13_4.sql - run the entire file.  The file is show below.   After you
have run the file do the select to see a table of the states.

```
m4_include(hw13_4.sql)
```

You should have both states and territories with square miles.

```
SELECT * from us_state;
```
