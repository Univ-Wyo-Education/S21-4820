# Interactive - 27 - 1 to 0 or 1 relationship 			(fk, unique)

Now that we have our tables let's look at the relationship between
`"t_ymx_user"` and "ct_login".   This is our 1 to 0 or 1 relationship.

It is provided by the primary key on ct_login being required but not
having a default value where a key is generated.   This is combined
with the foreign key constraint to `"t_ymux_user"`.

Try an insert to see if you can fake it out (the insert will fail).

```
insert into ct_login ( user_id, pg_acct ) values ( uuid_generate_v4(), 'x' );

```
