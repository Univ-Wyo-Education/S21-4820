m4_include(setup.m4)

# Interactive - 32 - only one a fixed set of rows.		(pre-papulae with key, pk, check-constraint on key)

There is a different way to implement a set of configuration items.  In this case the items
are stored one in each row in a set of fixed rows.


```
m4_include(hw32_1.sql)
```

With a table like this we can insert some values:

```
m4_include(hw32_2.sql)
```

If you have a fixed set of configuration items  this set could be
verified using a check constraint.

Triggers could be used to prevent deletes or to prevent updates of
items.
