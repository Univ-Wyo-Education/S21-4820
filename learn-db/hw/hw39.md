# Interactive - 39 - materialized views

One of the ways that you can improve performance in PostgreSQL and other SQL databases is a materialized view.
A regular view is a kind of "macro" that replaces the query's from with the body of the view.  

In a materialized view the data itself is copied into the "view" and you can add indexes and other things
that optimize queries on this set of data.

The downsize to materialized views is that the data can get out of sync with the original data.

Materialized views are very useful when the source of the data is a foreign data wrapper.  Especially
when the foreign data is slow or only periodically changes.

Let's use our table with some names in it. (From Interactive Homework 08)

```
create table name_list (
	name_list_id UUID NOT NULL DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() primary key,
	real_name text,
	age int check ( age > 0 and age < 154 ),	
	state char varying (2)
);

```

Now a materialize view that rolls up the count of the number of names in each state.

```
CREATE materialized view count_by_state_of_names as
	SELECT count(1) as count_by_state,
		state
	FROM name_list
	GROUP BY state
;
CREATE INDEX count_by_state_of_names_p1 on count_by_state_of_names ( count_by_state );
CREATE INDEX count_by_state_of_names_p2 on count_by_state_of_names ( state );

```

Now let's select the data:

```
SELECT * from count_by_state_of_names ;

```

You should get back 3 rows.
