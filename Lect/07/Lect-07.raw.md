##  Developer SQL Required                                              

Usually his is really a "full stack job" but you are working with
other people that are also "full stack" and that helps.



## Summary

1. If you want to be a Database Developer - for jobs like DBA you want to pursue some "certification" beyond just this class.
2. Build your CV - the project in this class is a good start.  Get that up and running on a Digital Ocean $5.00 a month system where you can demo it.  Add login/accounts to it.
Get familiar with the security side like JWT tokens and be able to talk about the good/bad of the Auth0 company.
3. Database jobs pay above average.
4. Some database jobs will have you on-call.
5. Most of them today are remote - by my count 92.2% are 100% remote.
6. Good familiarity with AWS, GCP and other hosing serveries is a requirement.
6. Should be good at using the Linux command line and probably VI.
