You should have a directory `.ssh` now in your home directory.
This is where the keys are stored.   The key pair is in 2 files.
The file we are interested in is the public key.  It will be
in the file `pub_ed25519.key`.

```
$ scp pub_ed25519.key pschlump@192.168.0.47:/home/pschlump
$ ssh  pschlump@192.168.0.47
...
...
...
$ cd .ssh
$ cat ../key_ed25519.key >> authorized_hosts
$ chmod 0600 authorized_hosts
```
