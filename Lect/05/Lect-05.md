	3. Redis
	4. CouchDB
	5. Hash Data Stores
4. Hardware Sort
5. More AI - GPT-3 as a front end
6. Performance, 50,000 TPS easy
	1M TPS - about $25,000 in hardware
	10M TPS - $200,000 in harware
	100M TPS - $100k-$500k (small) per month (leased)
6. Network Database
7. Time Series Database 
8. Text Search ( ElastiSearch )


Important things to remember.

1. Data is forever.  The same database at a bank that is there now will need to be there 30 to 50 years from now.
2. Migration to new systems is rare to non-existent.
3. We are dealing with a very hard to test system.
4. Maintenance / long term is the key.
